I got into the habit of taking down bits and pieces of things I learnt, as a reference. They eventually ended up in a big disorganised 'notes' directory. As I revisit and reorganise them, I will periodically put them up here.

<ul>
{{#site.projects.notes.exports}}
<li><a href='{{url}}/{{link}}'>{{title}}</a></li>
{{/site.projects.notes.exports}}
</ul>
