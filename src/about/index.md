# About

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Eddie, a philomath currently living in London, UK.

## Background

* I'm originally from Shengyang but spent my childhood in Belfast. Since then, I've lived in Cambridge, Johannesburg, Chennai and now London.
* I read Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge and hold an MSc in Computing Science at Imperial College London. Between that time, I had the amazing chance to work abroad, developing science content for an [eLearning company](http://www.heymath.com).

## Interests

* Usually I have a MooC or other course going at any one time, while rueing the fact that there's no time to take more!
* I enjoy tutoring at all levels of education. One of my favourite experiences was giving talks about the scientific method for classes of secondary school students in Kimberly for National Science Week. I'm a mentor for the Coursera [Bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computational-biology) specialisation and a [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) volunteer.
* Currently I work as a systems engineer at [Huddle](https://www.huddle.com), focusing on security and provisioning.
* I'm an avid reader and also enjoy playing guitar, bouldering and squash.
